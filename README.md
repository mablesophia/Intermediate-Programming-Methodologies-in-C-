# Intermediate-Programming-Methodologies-in-C-

# Course Description: 
A systematic approach to the design, construction and management of computer programs, emphasizing design, programming style, documentation, testing and debugging techniques. Strings, multidimensional arrays, structures, and classes. Pointers: # their use in arrays, parameters and dynamic allocation, linked lists.

# Student Learning Outcomes:
Read, analyze and explain intermediate level C++ programs and their efficiency.
Design solutions for intermediate level problems using appropriate design methodology incorporating intermediate programming constructs # including structures and objects.
Create algorithms, code, document, debug, and test intermediate level C++ programs.
